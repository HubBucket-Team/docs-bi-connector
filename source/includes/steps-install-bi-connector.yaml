title: Install the |bi|.
ref: install-bi-server
level: 4
pre: |
  Download the |bi| for your operating system from the
  `MongoDB Download Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center>`_.

  Extract the tarball you downloaded and install the programs within the
  ``bin/`` directory into a directory listed in your system ``PATH``.

  For example, on Unix-like operating systems, run the following:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    sudo install -m755 bin/mongo* /usr/local/bin/

title: Generate your schema definition file.
ref: generate-schema
level: 4
pre: |
  Provide a MongoDB server hostname, replace ``dbname`` with the name of your
  database, and optionally replace ``collname`` with the name of a collection.
  If you do not specify a collection, :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` will generate a
  schema from all collections in ``dbname``.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongodrdl --host example.com -d dbname [-c collname] -o schema.drdl
post: |
  .. note::
     The :option:`--host <mongodrdl --host>` option only accepts a hostname. You cannot
     provide a :ref:`MongoDB connection string <mongodb-uri>`.

  You can examine the generated ``schema.drdl`` file, and remove any fields or
  tables that are not part of your intended schema.
